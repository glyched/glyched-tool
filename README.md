                                                       what this is
this is a collection of my most-used tools currently i have added a simple file encryption system with fernet, a port scanner and sherlock
note: this is completly new and im still making it im still adding in the funtions and have not yet gotten to the input and user interface

                                                      ENCRYPTION VIA FERNET
this will both encrypt and decrypt your files, during encryption it will provide a filekey.key file which will contain your key, you require the
key to decrypt the file, it uses the cryptography library 
                                                         PORT SCANNER
its a port scanner it does what the name says! it scans a network for open ports and displays them
                                                          SHERLOCK
***what is sherlock***: this tool allows you to hunt down social media users via their username, this will look on many social media platforms for that user name and  return what users it found

***about***: this will download and install(if not already done) the sherlock tool and execute it, it will ask for the username you want to hunt
