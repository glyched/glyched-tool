**file encryption:** it uses fernet to encrypt a text/csv/document and produce a key, it makes it so that the encrypted  file cannot be decrypted without the filekey

**port scanner:** does what the name says! it scans a network for open ports

****sherlock:**** it is a tool which will scan all social media platforms to search for a specifed username, works well for targets using the same name on multiple social meida platforms

****bulk emailer***: send a simple email to all emails listed in  csv file using smtplib

****mac changer:**** spoofs your mac address, makes it harder to trace your device

****network scanner:**** will scan a network and return all devices connected to the network(ipv4 adresses and MAC adresses)
personal tips:
if you are trying to acsess information censored in your country try using a vpn, a free one is soft ether

if the program doesnt run, then try installing all the required dependancies 

upcomming: arp spoofer
